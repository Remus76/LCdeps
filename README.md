# Pre-built spdlog static library for LegacyClonk

This repository contains the files to build the static library target of the [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog) library used by LegacyClonk (LC).
It has been added because of its removal from the statically built LC dependencies and for more convenience when using LC debug builds.
